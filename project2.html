    <h1>Sudoku Solver Project Overview</h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Sudoku Solver is a program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles, a popular number puzzle...</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong>Made in Java, Python (Using recursion), Python (Using non-recursive method)</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Backtracking, Constraint Propagation, and Advanced Heuristics</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Developed a clean and intuitive interface to input and display Sudoku puzzles.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Efficiency:</strong> Implemented optimized algorithms to ensure quick and accurate puzzle solving.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Puzzle Input:</strong> Allows users to input custom Sudoku puzzles or select from a variety of preloaded puzzles.</li>
        <li><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong> Provides an option to visualize the solving process step-by-step, helping users understand the logic behind each move.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm Design:</strong> Overcame the complexity of designing and implementing efficient solving algorithms by researching and testing various approaches, ultimately settling on backtracking combined with constraint propagation.</p>
    <p><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Ensured a smooth and interactive user experience by focusing on a responsive and user-friendly interface design.</p>
    <h2>Outcome and Learning</h2>
    <p>Successfully developed a robust Sudoku Solver that not only solves puzzles quickly and accurately but also serves as a learning tool for users interested in algorithm design and problem-solving techniques. This project honed my skills in algorithm development, user interface design, and debugging complex programs.</p>
