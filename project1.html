    <h1>Tower of Hanoi Project Overview</h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes...</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong>Java (For Backend)</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Recursive algorithm implementation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Designed a user-friendly interface to visualize the movement of disks.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Efficiency:</strong> Optimized the recursive algorithm for efficient problem-solving.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Allows users to change the number of disks and see the steps to solve the puzzle.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Component:</strong> Provides explanations of each move and the logic behind the recursive algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p><strong>Recursive Complexity:</strong> Overcame the challenge of understanding and implementing the recursive nature of the problem by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.</p>
    <p><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Ensured smooth user interaction by developing a clear and intuitive interface, allowing users to easily manipulate the puzzle.</p>
    <h2>Outcome and Learning</h2>
    <p>Successfully developed a fully functional Tower of Hanoi puzzle that not only serves as a challenging game but also as an educational tool to understand recursive algorithms. This project improved my problem-solving skills, deepened my understanding of recursion, and enhanced my ability to develop user-friendly applications.</p>
